<h1> About Me </h1>
Hello! My name is kelly. I'm paid to be a web developer for a company called
<a href="www.spoonflower.com">Spoonflower</a>. We make custom printed fabric for anyone that uploads
and image to our site. It's pretty cool (but don't trust me, I'm biased).
<br /><br />
I've been interested in sewing since I was a child, but working for a company where I have access
to a LARGE supply of fabric has definitely encouraged that hobby. When I sew, my interest is
definitely in apparel, every day clothing and costumes. I also recently acquired a floor loom, and
have taken my love of fabric to a new level. Though I'm new to it, I am madly in love with weaving,
and plan to getting to a point where I feel comfortable sewing clothing out of cloth I have woven
myself.
<br /><br />
I've loved books and reading for my entire life, and I especially love sharing what I read.
Do you want to hear my opinion on any book?
<a href="www.goodreads.com/user/show/5052060-insouciantly">
	Recommend it to me on goodreads!
</a>
So, since I'm a developer, I actually built this blog app for myself for the ground up. I'll try to
write something eventually so you can recommend books without having a goodreads account.
<br /><br />
I have a lot of other good plans for this site eventually, but for now you can browse posts by any
category above.

<% content_for :sidebar do %>
	<h2><%= link_to "More About Me", tag_path(40) %></h2>
	<% @about_feed.each do |blog| %>
		<div class="date"><%= blog.posted_at.strftime("%m/%d/%y")%></div>
		<%= image_tag(blog.fizz_photo.filepath, :width => "100%") %>
		<b><%= link_to blog.title, blog_url(blog) %></b><br />
		<%= truncate(strip_tags(blog.body), length: 130)) %>
		<hr />
	<% end %>
<% end %>
