		<span style="font-size:2em">Welcome to dress insouciantly! </span>This is my first attempt at
		of those blog things that were cool 10 years ago. I like sewing, and want an excuse to improve the
		quality of photographs I take of sewing projects. I recently bought a loom, and so you'll
		likely see a bunch of weaving projects. I also love to read, and like to share books I
		love. <span style="font-size:1.5em">Click on a post below to read more!</span> Or on a topic above.
