<h1> I'M MAKING A WEBSITE</h1>
<div style="font-family:raleway; font-size:18px; width:75%; padding-left:5%; display:block">
Hello. My name is Kelly. I've been vaguely sort of maintainging a quote-un-quote "blog" at <a href="http://insouciantly.tumblr.com"> insouciantly.tumblr.com</a> for a number of years, but recently I've felt the call to build something a little more personal for myself. That something will probably live here. I don't know yet what that something will be, but it will probably have very similar content to the tumblr. It will probably have a lot about sewing, and weaving, and other stuff I make. It'll have a lot of pictures, and occasionally I'll probably ramble on about something random. For now, I'm curious about why you're here, and if and why and how I can pursuade you to return. If you wouldn't mind filling out the lovely form below, I'll try to put what you have to say to good use.
